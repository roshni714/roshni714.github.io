I am a fourth-year PhD student in computer science at Stanford University. My research focuses on machine learning and causal inference. I am advised by [Stefan Wager](https://web.stanford.edu/~swager/) and supported by a [Spectrum PHS Pilot Grant](https://med.stanford.edu/phs/research/grants/pilot-grants.html), [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), [Stanford Ethics in Society Fellowship](https://ethicsinsociety.stanford.edu/graduate/graduate-fellowships), and [Stanford Data Science Scholar Award](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-data-science-scholars-program). I received double BS degrees in computer science and math at MIT, where I was fortunate to work with [Igor Gilitschenski](https://www.gilitschenski.org/igor/), [Daniela Rus](http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/), and [John Guttag](https://people.csail.mit.edu/guttag/) in my first research experiences.

Outside of research, I love to run, swim, [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90432444-roshni-sahoo). I also mentor local high school students through [Stanford FAST](https://fast.stanford.edu/). Previously, I co-organized [Computing & Society](https://stanford-cscs.github.io/) and [Grad WiCS](https://www.stanfordwomenincomputerscience.com/).
