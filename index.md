I am a final-year PhD student in computer science at Stanford University. My research focuses on data-driven decision making for sustainable development, drawing upon machine learning, causal inference, and optimization. I am fortunate to be advised by [Stefan Wager](https://web.stanford.edu/~swager/). I am supported by a [Stanford DARE Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/dare), [Stanford Data Science Fellowship](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-data-science-scholars-program), and [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

Previously, I studied computer science and math at MIT, where I was lucky to learn from [Igor Gilitschenski](https://www.gilitschenski.org/igor/), [Daniela Rus](http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/), and [John Guttag](https://people.csail.mit.edu/guttag/) in my first research experiences.

Outside of research, I love to practice yoga, run, swim, and [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90432444-roshni-sahoo).
