I am a final-year PhD student in computer science at Stanford University. I work on data-driven decision making for social impact. My research develops statistical methodology to address challenges in [public health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14858) and [economic development](/JMP.pdf), combining tools from machine learning, causal inference, and optimization.

I will be presenting at INFORMS about [what it would cost to end extreme poverty](/JMP.pdf) on Monday October 27, 4:30-4:45pm. I hope to see you there!

I am fortunate to be advised by [Stefan Wager](https://web.stanford.edu/~swager/) during my PhD. I am supported by a [Stanford DARE Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/dare), [Stanford Data Science Fellowship](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-data-science-scholars-program), and [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). Previously, I studied computer science and math at MIT, where I was lucky to learn from [Igor Gilitschenski](https://www.gilitschenski.org/igor/), [Daniela Rus](http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/), and [John Guttag](https://people.csail.mit.edu/guttag/) in my first research experiences.

Outside of research, I love to practice yoga, run, swim, and [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90432444-roshni-sahoo).
