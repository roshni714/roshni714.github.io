I am a first-year PhD student in computer science at Stanford University, advised by [Stefan Wager](https://web.stanford.edu/~swager/){:target="_blank"} and supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). Previously, I majored in computer science and math and minored in literature at MIT. 
<!-- During undergrad, I was fortunate to work with [Igor Gilitschenski](https://www.gilitschenski.org/igor/), [Daniela Rus](http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/), and [John Guttag](https://people.csail.mit.edu/guttag/) in my first research experiences. -->

I am fascinated by human interaction with machine learning systems, as it relates to uncertainty quantification, decision making, game theory, and experimental design. I also like to [read books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90432444-roshni-sahoo), [talk about tech+society](https://stanford-cscs.github.io/), and [do outdoorsy things with my friends](../miscellaneous/).

Feel free to reach out if we share any interests! Also, happy to chat about getting involved in research as an undergrad, creating an inclusive research environment, diversity etc. You can email me at rsahoo [at] stanford [dot] edu.
